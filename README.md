## Project Overview
Oracle Health Patient Portal is an application that helps patients schedule appointments, refill their medications, communicate with their providers, and track their health. The administrative console user guide provides instructions that allow customers to set up and configure the patient portal for their unique needs. In addition to creating the user documentation for the administrative console, I collaborated with product managers, designers, and engineers to create UI text.

The About Oracle Health Patient Portal page is a document required by healthcare IT regulations.
