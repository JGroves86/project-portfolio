## About Me
I graduated from Truman State University in Kirksville, MO in 2007 with a BA in Communication with an emphasis in Journalism. I worked at a media company in central Iowa where I was the news director and morning host for a morning radio program and a reporter covering all aspects of local news. During that time, I covered everything from personal interest stories to parks department meetings to police to court proceedings. 

In 2008, I moved to Kansas City, MO and worked on a marketing campaign for AT&T where we launched their fiber optic service in Kansas City. 

In 2009, I got a job at Grantham University working with veterans and active duty military service members as an academic advisor. During that time, I attended classes myself, receiving my MBA in project management in 2011. During my time at Grantham, I created materials that improved the onboarding process, setting student expectations and standardizing welcome materials and class pathways for different degree programs. As a result, the number of students returning for additional classes increased by 12 percent. I then helped launch a free, optional financial literacy course for students and their spouses, which grew to having more than 300 students enrolled by the third semester it was available.

In 2012, I joined Cerner Corporation, a healthcare IT company, as a learning developer. In that role, I created training materials for customers.
